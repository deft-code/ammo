#summary The coding standard we'll use

= Introduction =
This standard is by no means set in stone.  It will continue to morph as our coding styles blend of the next month.  After that we'll lock it down.

==Directory Structure==
The directory structure will mirror SFML's.
  * trunk
    * docs
    * src
      * ammo
        * graphics
        * network
        * audio
        * physics
        * lua
    * build
      * VS2008
      * slickedit
      * others (codeblocks, xcode, whatever you use)
  

==Example Class==
look at RakNet for a good example of how to do doxygen comments right.
{{{

/// doxygen comment for class
class ClassName
{
public:
   /// silly description, not really needed here
   ClassName( void );

   /// more silly stuff
   ~ClassName( void );

   /// what does this do?
   void MethodOne( void );
   
   /// what does this do?
   /// @param foo what does this parameter do
   /// @returns the results of MethodTwo
   int MethodTwo( int foo );

private:
   /// what this member is for
   int _privateMembers;

   /// what this member is for
   int _private_members_alt
};
